# Rafters 2D

A Rafter calculator developed with Tauri and React.
Developed with [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
Developed with [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction)
Developed with [Konva](https://konvajs.org/)

I also created a helper lib of right angle utility functions in rust, call [pythagoras](https://github.com/dskyberg/pythagoras).  Be sure to clone the help library locally before building Rafters 2D.
